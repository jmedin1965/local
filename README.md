# local
Linux /usr/local scripts

Just a collection of scripts I keep re-cerating or copying arround on my ubuntu linux machines.
This is my first attempt at managing this via a github repository.

To get this repository from command line;

git pull https://jmedin1965@github.com/jmedin1965/local

To set up some defaults so you don't have to keep typing 'git push origin master'

git remote add origin https://jmedin1965@github.com/jmedin1965/local
git push --set-upstream origin master
